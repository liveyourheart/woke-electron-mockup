# woke-electron

Woke is a productivity application currently under development.  It's focus is time management and habit tracking.
Eventually, woke will be universally available as web, mobile, and desktop applications.  This is the desktop application
being developed in Node, Electron, and React.  

### Development

###### Prerequisites

I have only tested this on Mac OS X, it should also run on Windows 10

* Node
* NPM
* Browserify
* Watchify

##### Installation

To Install and Run:

```
* git clone git@github.com:liveyourheart/woke-electron.git
* npm install
* npm run watch 
* npm run start
```

The Icon will populate in your menu bar.  Currently, the icon is a super cool cat that comes with [Max Ogden's awesome menubar package](https://github.com/maxogden/menubar).
